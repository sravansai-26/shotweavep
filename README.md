üìù **3. Technical Overview & Stack**

Shotweave uses a unified Python/Flask backend for its heavy lifting (AI/API) and a modern React/Vite frontend for a cinematic user experience.

| Component | Technology | Core Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion | Cinematic UI, Dynamic Role-Based Dashboards, Smooth Transitions. |
| **Backend API** | Python, Flask, Flask-CORS | Secure User Auth (with **BCrypt Hashing**), REST Endpoints for all 4 roles. |
| **AI/ML Core** | SpaCy (NLP) | Script breakdown, location/character identification, scheduling estimates. |
| **AI/ML Core** | Scikit-learn | Predictive Regression Model for AI Risk Meter. |
| **Database** | MongoDB | Flexible NoSQL data storage for users, vendors, and production data. |

‚öôÔ∏è **4. How to Run Locally (Step-by-Step)**

The project can be run natively (requires Python/Node) or via Docker Compose (recommended for a stable demo).

### A. Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18+) & NPM
* Python (v3.10+) & pip
* MongoDB Instance (Local or Cloud) running on port 27017.

### B. Setup (Backend First)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sravansai-26/shotweavep.git](https://github.com/sravansai-26/shotweavep.git)
    cd shotweavep
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment:** Create a file named `.env` inside the project root or `src/server/` directory.
    ```
    # src/server/.env (or project root .env)
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/shotweave" 
    ```

3.  **Run Backend (Flask/AI):**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd src/server
    # Install dependencies (ensure a virtual environment is active)
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    # Run the Flask app
    python app.py 
    ```
    *(The backend will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000)*

4.  **Run Frontend (React):**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the client directory
    cd ../client 
    # Install dependencies (use this flag due to common ESLint/Vite compatibility issues)
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    # Run the React development server
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(The frontend will start on http://127.0.0.1:5173)*

### C. Testing & User Credentials

* **Access:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
* **Create Users:** Go to `/signup` and create users for all four roles (Producer/CEO, Line Producer, 1st AD/Unit Manager, VFX Supervisor/Director) to test dynamic routing.

üåê **5. Deployment & Endpoints (REQUIRED)**

The explicit service endpoints are listed in the required format.

### A. IP Address & Port Reporting

See the required table format in [deployment/ENDPOINTS.md](deployment/ENDPOINTS.md).

***Note: If you cannot host publicly, the demonstration video is available.***

### B. Docker Compose (For Validation)

The project includes Dockerfiles and a `docker-compose.yml` (if created) for automated setup. This is the recommended validation path.

1.  **Install Docker & Docker Compose.**
2.  **Run the services (from the directory containing `docker-compose.yml`):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
3.  **Access:** The application will be live at `http://localhost:5173`.

### C. Demonstration Video

| Component | Status | Host/Port |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Demo Video (Offline Submission)** | Yes | **assets/demo.mp4** |

‚ö†Ô∏è **6. Known Limitations & TODOs (MVP Scope)**

| Category | Limitation | Future Work / TODO |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI/ML** | Models are currently trained on mock data (for security and speed). | Train Scikit-learn model on industry-validated data sets. Implement NLP for regional languages. |
| **Security** | MongoDB URI requires local configuration in `.env`. | Implement full token-based (JWT) authentication flow. |
| **Integration** | Dashboards use mock input forms for the Risk Meter calculation. | Implement real Daily Progress Report (DPR) to dynamically feed the Risk Meter model. |
| **LVR** | Vendor Contact/Deal-Making is simulated via a client-side delay. | Integrate actual email API for automated quote generation/acceptance. |
